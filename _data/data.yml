    title: About
    summary: |
      South African-born actuary and data scientist with experience across insurance, finance, and retail. I build AI solutions by understanding what the technology can do, what the data actually shows, and how decisions get made in practice.

      My career has taken me from South Africa to Australia, then to Boston for graduate study, and back to Australia. Working across different countries and business contexts has shaped how I approach problems and what it takes to bridge technical capability with practical execution.

      I've led teams at Auto & General and Fidelity Investments, contributed open-source tools used in production systems, and published research on bandits and recommender systems. Fellow of both the Actuarial Society of South Africa and the Actuaries Institute of Australia. Master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering from Harvard.

perspective:
    title: Perspective
    content: |
      The best AI solutions start with understanding how decisions actually get made, not how we think they should be made. Technical excellence matters less than whether a model fits how the business operates and inspires enough confidence to be used. In regulated industries especially, this means spending as much time on business domain, regulatory constraints, and organizational decision processes as on algorithms.

      Given how rapidly AI capabilities are evolving, adaptability matters as much as expertise. The technology we use to solve problems is changing, and the problems themselves are shifting as new capabilities emerge. I look for people who stay curious about these changes and can thoughtfully evaluate when new approaches actually serve business needs versus when established methods remain the right choice.

    title: Interests
    intro: Outside work, I spend weekends with my wife and son exploring Brisbane, finding good pastries, ice cream spots, and friendly dogs. Rugby fan with a particular soft spot for the Springboks. I also climb regularly, drawn to the problem-solving aspect as much as the physical challenge. Both rugby and climbing are things I'm looking forward to sharing with my son when he's ready.
