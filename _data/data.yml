    info:
      - role: | 
          Fidelity Investments
        details: |
          As a Director of Data Science at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fcatalyst.com/overview), 
          I lead a talented team focused on personalization, recommender systems, and 
          marketing optimization in both digital and distribution channels.
      - role: |
          Quantium
        details: |
          At [Quantium](https://quantium.com/), I honed my analytical skills and became proficient in data analysis, 
          statistical modeling, and technical communication, while working on a diverse range of projects 
          across the Insurance, Banking, and Retail industries. Surrounded by a dynamic and talented team at Quantium, 
          I spent five years there building a solid foundation in analytics and data science. 

          While working, I completed the board exams to become a qualified actuary and receive Fellowship
          designation from both the [Actuarial Society of South Africa](https://www.actuarialsociety.org.za/) 
          and the [Actuaries Institute of Australia](https://www.actuaries.asn.au/).

education:
    title: Education
    info:
      - role: | 
          Harvard University
        details: |
          I completed a masters degree in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) at 
          [Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/). 
          During my time at Harvard, I delved into advanced courses, exploring topics such as decision theory, 
          optimization, and computing systems. My research project involved numerical methods, optimization, and 
          large-scale parallel computing to study optimal heat transfer solutions in Rayleigh-Bénard convection.
      - role: |
          University of Pretoria
        details: |
          I completed a BSc degree in [Actuarial Science and Financial Mathematics](https://www.up.ac.za/insurance-and-actuarial-science) 
          at University of Pretoria. The program not only provided me with a rigorous academic 
          foundation in mathematics and statistics, but also cultivated skills needed to develop 
          realistic solutions to complex problems and with a forward-looking outlook on issues.

    title: Interests
    intro: Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and 1-year old boy. 
           We love exploring places, finding good pastries, ice-cream, and friendly dogs to play with.
           I'm also an avid rugby fan and rock climber (both of which I hope to one day share with my son).
